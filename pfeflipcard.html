              <p>There are two main delivery methods for gene therapy: ex vivo (outside the body) and in vivo (inside the body).</p>
              <p>Ex vivo requires harvesting a patient’s cells and then reintroducing them into the patient. These therapies are often evaluated for blood-related disorders, such as leukemia and lymphoma, as well as some rare diseases.</p> 
              <p>The second approach to gene therapy, in vivo, is better suited for targeting specific organs in the body. This technique uses a vector, which serves as a delivery vehicle, to shuttle genetic material directly to patients’ cells.</p>
              <p>Pfizer is currently focused on developing in-vivo adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for patients with rare diseases. These patients have inherited genetic conditions that are caused by a single-gene mutation, such as hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). When the mutation occurs, it causes a defective protein to be produced, leading to the patient’s specific medical condition.</p> 
              <p>“Our goal is to replace a mutated or defective gene with a healthy or more effective copy,” says Clark Pan, Vice President, Gene Therapy and Discovery Biology. “This would allow the patient to be able to produce a version of the protein, which would help the body to function as expected.”</p>
